# mbti-link-sharing
Course project analyzing Myers Briggs Personality Types' tendency to post URLs on a public forum

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/mbti-type

Link regex: https://www.codegrepper.com/code-examples/delphi/all+url+regex

Conclusion: Types with a given characteristic all had approximately the same ratio of links posted to total posts (~0.06), while there were many more observed differences in the ratios of the specific personality types. This suggests that perhaps there is less significance in the effect of an individual personality characteristic on the posting of URLs, but that the interaction of these characteristics to form a greater personality type is what significantly impacts the behavior of posting links on a public forum.
